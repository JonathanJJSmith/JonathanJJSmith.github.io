<p>The development of this Python Text Adventure was relatively easy, due to the fact it was primarily a Python port of my Javascript text based adventure game, Jonasan Iliversiooq. However, with every programmer's experience with coding something, I had my difficulties as well. The most notable two difficulties I had were figuring out how to clear the screen and a bug where it said I had too many states in the state machine. Mr. Landfried taught me the code on how to clear the command prompt in Python and he told me that the green squiggly line under the while loop in the state machine didn't affect anything.</p>
