        <p>Hi! I'm Jonathan Smith, a 15 year old sophomore at Palm Desert High School. My biggest passions are video game development, film production, and digital art. Academics-wise, I want to get a degree that can get me into video game development (All fields of that area like graphics, programming, and music). Video games have always inspired me. Another thing that inspires me is the "behind-the-scenes" of the video game. So I wanted to know how video games work and that is why I got into that field.</p>
    
        <p> I sought my other interest of film/broadcasting and attempted to begin a career on YouTube. I was somewhat successful and I still do this passion as a hobby to this very day (not for monetary reasons yet). I am also a really good artist (in both painting and music). I have painted plenty of pictures and composed many songs. Some of my greatest works include a <a href="megaman10.html">custom box art cover for Megaman 10</a> and an original song called Once. I still do these art and music hobbies to this very day as well.</p>
    
        <p>Now here are some of my real life accomplishments and achievements; I have gotten honor roll several times throughout middle school, even getting an award from the State of California for all of my determination, perserverance, wide vision, and sweat to get such an award. What is that award you say? It's the Every Student Succeeding Award of 2019! Now I have gotten plenty of awards in elementary, but there is one worth mentioning which is the President's Education Awards Program (which I got at the end of my elementary school time for "Outstanding Academic Excellence", signed in fine ink by the 44th president of the United States!).</p>
    
        <p>I have engaged in plenty of extracurricular activities in my childhood. Here are some extracurricular activites that I have engaged in that are worth listing:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Battle of the Books in 3rd Grade</li>
        <li>Choir in 4th Grade</li>
        <li>Robotics in 5th Grade</li>
        <li>Secretary for the Environmental Club in 7th Grade</li>
        <li>Long time member of the Advanced Garden Club in 8th Grade</li>
        <li>Got into JV Water Polo Team during first semester of freshman year</li>
        </ul>
